          {
              amount      => 4200,
              token       => '098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6',

      );

DESCRIPTION
    Paymill::REST is a wrapper around PAYMILL's payment API.

GENERAL ARCHITECTURE
    It is intended that things such creating and retrieving items is done
    through operations called on the respective "Paymill::REST::*" modules
    (a so called item factory), so everything related to transactions is
    achieved through Paymill::REST::Transactions.

    Each operation of those factories is returning one or a list of the
    appropriate item modules, so operations called on
    Paymill::REST::Transactions are returning one or a list of
    Paymill::REST::Item::Transaction.

  AVAILABLE OPERATIONS
    Not all operations are available to every item factory (currently only
    "delete" is not available to Paymill::REST::Item::Refund).

    Creating new items
        Paymill::REST::Operations::Create

    Delete existing items
        Paymill::REST::Operations::Delete

    Find a single item
        Paymill::REST::Operations::Find

    List all or a subset of items
        Paymill::REST::Operations::List

CONFIGURATION
    Each item factory inherits from Paymill::REST::Base, which is holding
    all the configuration. The following options are available:

    api_key
        Defines your private API key which you get from PAYMILL.

    proxy
        An URI or URI string which is passed to LWP::UserAgent's "proxy"
        method for connecting to the PAYMILL API.

    Note: every other option you'll find in the code is only meant for
    development of this module and shouldn't be changed!
